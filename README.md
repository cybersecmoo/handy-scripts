# Handy Scripts #

## Useful Scripts for Pentesting and Things Like That ##

This repo is split into (currently) two directories:

- `exploit`: This is for scripts which exploit vulnerabilities. These are intended as comparatively generic exploits, as opposed to PoCs for specific vulns (which may be found in other repos of mine). So these might be generic (No)SQL Injection scripts, Kerberoasting scripts, AS_REProasting scripts, that kind of thing.

- `recon`: This is for scripts which help in enumerating a target. Some of these will mirror functionality from, say, WinPEAS, where the latter might be a bit too big for certain cases where we only want to run one or two enumeration methods.
